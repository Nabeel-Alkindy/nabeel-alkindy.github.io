# nabeel-alkindy.github.io

  The repository was structured in such a way that every directory is clear and concise. The files within, all pertain to the specific categories
as indicated by the directory names. (Ex: The "css" directory has "main.css" which contains the stylesheet for the webpage).

  The Jekyll section of the assignment was implemented in the "layouts" directory. This was used to inject various types of content into the 
webpage and was achieved by using "liquid tags" as a placeholder that can be used to substitute information of out choosing.
  
   A "foreach" loop was used to automatically generate an unordered list of any blog posts that we make, instead of having to do this for each individual post.
   
   The line "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/main.css"></head>" was used to relate the contents of what we want to display to the stylesheet 
   that was predetermined on the CSS formatting that was done in "main.css"
